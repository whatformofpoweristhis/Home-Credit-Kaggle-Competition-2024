## Description
The goal of this competition is to predict which clients are more likely to default on their loans. The evaluation will favor solutions that are stable over time. 

In this competition, I achieved a public leaderboard score of 0.599 and a private leaderboard score of 0.524 by using a combination of LightGBM and CatBoost models without employing any metric hacks. When I used metric hacks, my notebook reached a highest private leaderboard score of 0.591.

However, since only two submissions could be chosen for the final entry, my team missed the opportunity to achieve 5th place and ultimately won a silver medal in the competition, finishing rank **78/3883**.
